# Story


The band Dead Gray began as a one-man project by Andris Sipos (ex-Nuke, ex-Strong Deformity) in the mid-2010s. The first self-titled EP was released on October 29, 2021, featuring Andris and Sanyi Bánfalvi (Ákos, ex-Magma Rise, ex-Neck Sprain) as founding members. In the summer of 2023, they found Andris Áldott (Mogul), and by the end of that year, the lineup was completed with the addition of Gergő László (Dungaree).

In 2024 the band was preparing to record their debut, full length album called: Bone Marrow. The album was recorded under extraordinary circumstances in a countryside castle to fully reach the potential of their unique sound. The release is expected in the first half of 2025!

# Music

Dead Gray could be categorized as post-grunge metal, but there's more to their story:
Dead Gray fundamentally aims to be a fusion of “upliftingly-depressive” moods, painting the shades between black and white. It encompasses heavy grooves, transience, grief, and at the same time the importance of triplets. The cornerstones of this monochromatic palette are Alice in Chains, Soundgarden and of course, Pantera. These are the frameworks they sometimes step out of—and yet, never truly leave.

Their songs revolve around themes of letting go.
